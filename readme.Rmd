## Overview

Play casino games in the R console!

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("anthonypileggi/casino")
```

## Getting Started

### Create a Player
Start off by creating your player.

```{r}
library(casino)

# Create a new player
player <- Player$new(name = "Anthony", amount = 100)
player
```

Then it's time to head off to the casino!
What should we play first?

### Poker (5-card stud)
```{r}
x <- Poker$new(who = player, type = "stud")
x$play(bet = 5)
x$play(bet = 10)
x$play(bet = 15)
player <- x$cash_out()     # leave the table
```

### Poker (5-card draw)
```{r}
x <- Poker$new(who = player, type = "draw")
x$play(bet = 15)
x$hold(1, 2, 5)
x$draw()
player <- x$cash_out()     # leave the table
```

### Blackjack
```{r}
x <- Blackjack$new(who = player)
for (i in 1:5)
  x$play(bet = 5)$stand()
player <- x$cash_out()
```

### Cashing out

What a fun day at the casino!  Or, was it?
Let's see how we did...
```{r}
# Overall
player$summarize_history()

# By Game
player$summarize_history(game)  
```

Well I guess you'll be back tomorrow.  See you then!
