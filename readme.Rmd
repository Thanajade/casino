## Overview

Play casino games in the R console!

Available games:

  - Poker (5-card draw/stud)
  - Blackjack
  - Slot machine

  
## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("anthonypileggi/casino")
```


## Quick Start
Are you getting impatient already?  Then use `play()` to get started immediately.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
casino::play()
```


## Setup (`.casino`)
All players must agree to our policies on recording activity.
If you do not agree, you cannot play.  House rules!

```{r}
library(casino)

# create a local file for storing persisent player data
setup()
```

This allows us to store player information persistently between games and R sessions.


## Create a Player
You can create a new player manually.

```{r}

# Create a new player
Player$new(name = "Player 1")

# View all available player profiles
players()
```

Or just start playing, and one will automatically be created for you.

```{r}
# Start a new game (this will auto-create a player)
Blackjack$new(who = "Player 2")

# View all available player profiles (again)
players()
```


## Play Casino Games

Now it's time to head off to the casino!
What do you want to play first?!


### Poker (5-card stud)
```{r}
x <- Poker$new(who = "Player 1", type = "stud", bet = 10)

# play a game
x$play()

# specify a different bet for this game
x$play(bet = 5)
```


### Poker (5-card draw)
```{r}
x <- Poker$new(who = "Player 1", type = "draw", bet = 20)

# play a game
x$play()

x$hold(1, 2, 5)    # hold cards in positions {1, 2, 5}

x$draw()           # draw new cards for positions {3, 4}
```

### Blackjack
```{r}
x <- Blackjack$new(who = "Player 1", bet = 25)

x$play()$stand()
```

### Slot Machine
```{r}
x <- Slots$new(who = "Player 1", bet = 1)

x$play()

# set the `spins` argument to play > 1 game at a time
x$play(spins = 2)
```


## I think I have a gambling problem

If you want to play a lot of games, you can write a script.  
Just make sure to silence the output (`verbose = FALSE`) and sounds (`sound = FALSE`).

```{r, messages = FALSE}
# poker (stud)
x <- Poker$new(who = "Player 1", type = "stud", bet = 10, verbose = FALSE, sound = FALSE)
for (i in 1:50) 
  suppressMessages(x$play())

# blackjack (blind)
x <- Blackjack$new(who = "Player 1", bet = 5, verbose = FALSE, sound = FALSE)
for (i in 1:50) {
  suppressMessages(x$play())
  if (x$active)
    x$stand()
}

# penny slots
x <- Slots$new(who = "Player 1", bet = 1, verbose = FALSE, sound = FALSE)
suppressMessages(x$play(spins = 50))
```


## Ok, now I lost everything...

If you run out of money, the Bank will immediately loan you 100.

> You: "So, what's the interest rate on this loan?"  
> Bank: "Oh, don't worry.  It's very reasonable..."


## Wait, how much did you say I owe?

```{r}
# player profile is stored in `$who` of a game object
player <- x$who

player$debt()
```


## It's closing time...

What a fun day at the casino!  Or, was it?
```{r}
# player profile is stored in `$who` of a game object
player <- x$who

# Overall
player$summary()

# By Game
player$summary(game)  
```

Let's relive the excitement!
```{r plot-history, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
player$plot()
```

Well, I guess we'll you'll be back tomorrow.  See you then!
